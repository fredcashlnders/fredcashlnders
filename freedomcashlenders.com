The interest rates on these loans are often very high. For just a few thousand dollars (most lenders wonâ€™t offer much more than $10,000 or $15,000 at most), the borrower could be on the hook for an APR approaching 400 percent or more.

Lenders expect their money to be paid back quickly, within a year. Because of the short timeline, the monthly payments will be much higher than other types of borrowing. In some cases, such as payday loans, the money may need to be repaid in just a month or two weeks, which can put great stress on your finances.

You need to make sure you have a solid plan to pay it back within the terms of the loan because the consequences can cost you even more. Sizable late fees will accrue if you cannot repay the principal within the allotted terms.
