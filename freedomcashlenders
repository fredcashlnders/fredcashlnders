The biggest drawback to short-term loans is that they often do not adequately solve the underlying problems that cause you to need a short-term loan. In fact, with their high interest rates and fees, they often worsen the problem and become a debt trap.

You have to pay the interest and fees to get the short-term loan, so you have less money next month, making it even more likely you’ll need another loan or refinance the original loan. You’ll be charged more fees when refinancing or extending the original loan. It’s a vicious cycle that’s difficult to escape.
