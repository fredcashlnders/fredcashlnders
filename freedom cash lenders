Asking friends and family: If you borrow money from friends and family, make sure that both of you are clear on whether and how the money should be repaid — otherwise, the loan can damage your relationship.
Borrowing from the equity in your home: If you have a larger emergency or one that is not urgent and own your home, you may be able to tap into your home’s equity with a home equity loan or line of credit. These alternatives usually take a few weeks.
Buy now, pay later loan: Buy now pay later services are growing in popularity. These lenders and services allow borrowers to make interest-free installments over a set time, typically over about six weeks. The terms vary widely, however, and some plans last much longer. While the longer repayment timelines may sometimes assess interest, buy now, pay later can be a less expensive option than typical short-term loans.
